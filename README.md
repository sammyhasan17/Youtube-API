This Jupyter Notebook uses the YouTube Data API to collect video data from several channels and applies sentiment analysis to video titles and descriptions using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. The results are visualized with two key graphs:

1. **Scatter Plot:** Displays the sentiment scores for videos across all channels, grouped by channel.
2. **Bar Plot:** Shows sentiment scores for up to 100 videos from the Jordan B Peterson channel.

The project demonstrates how to combine big data from the YouTube API with sentiment analysis and data visualization for insights into channel content.
